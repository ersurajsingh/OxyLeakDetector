# Dual Sense Oxygen Leak Detector

## Introduction
Incidents of oxygen leaks in healthcare facilities pose severe risks to both patients and infrastructure. Lack of an effective, affordable, and real-time oxygen leak detection solution contributes to these incidents. Traditional methods are often expensive, lack precision, and do not provide timely alerts, jeopardizing safety standards.

Addressing this critical issue requires an innovative approach that combines advanced sensing technologies to enhance accuracy, affordability, and the overall safety of oxygen storage and usage environments.

## Solution Overview
Our proposed solution, named DualSense Leak Detector, integrates acoustic and biochemical sensors to detect oxygen leaks in real-time. The acoustic sensor captures hissing sounds associated with leaks, while the biochemical sensor measures oxygen levels. The data from these sensors will be processed using a microcontroller (Arduino) and displayed on a user-friendly interface.
The device is equipped with OOM202 Sensors and Knowles' SPH0645LM4H digital microphone array that function as an acoustic camera, providing real-time audio monitoring to pinpoint the exact location and intensity of potential leaks .The solution integrates high-precision sensors specifically calibrated to discern minute variations in oxygen levels.
The microcontroller orchestrates the detection process with unparalleled accuracy. This microcontroller-based approach not only enhances the adaptability of the device but also allows for intricate programming and real-time data analysis.
Continuous data logging will capture the frequency, duration, and intensity of detected leaks. This data will be collated and analyzed to refine sensitivity and specificity, ensuring minimal false alarms and maximized detection capability.
Our medtech device offers a cost-effective alternative to foreign products, with an estimated implementation cost of 12500 rupees. This is a fraction of the cost of the foreign counterpart priced at 55,000 rs.The substantial cost reduction enhances accessibility and affordability, making our solution a viable option for a broader market.
Our Market Entry Strategy would be to Build partnerships with key stakeholders, such as distributors and healthcare providers, to help facilitate market entry and organize free health checkup camps to showcase the device .
We aim to provide the device at rentals of 999/month .
