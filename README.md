# Oxygen Leak Detector
During transfer of liquid medical oxygen(LMO)to many tanks installed in hospital, the hose pipe (connecting hose) is connected to input of tanks and transfer of LMO is done. Thereafter, the connection is removed and connected to another tank, then one after another. 
During the engagement-disengagement of connection pipe every time, the leakage happens.The mechanism has been designed to avoid the loss of oxygen during transfer of LMO to tanks.
Proposed is the design of a Low Cost - High Sensitivity Acoustic Camera. 
This setup will be able to detect Oxygen Leakage Hotspot while the patient is sleeping with the oxygen mask on as improper fixing of oxygen mask on face is a reason for oxygen wastage. 
Besides, it can also be used while we are transferring liquid medical oxygen (LMO) from a capsule (Mobile tank) to tanks installed in hospitals.
